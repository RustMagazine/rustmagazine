## How to maintain Rust Magazine

### Zine

Rust Magazine is powered by [zine], a user-friendly static site generator designed specifically for magazines. Familiarity with zine is a valuable asset in maintaining the magazine as it offers built-in code blocks, such as the `urlpreview` to display an OGP preview of a URL, and `quote` to highlight someone's sentence. This is a good use case for an interview article. The repository and accompanying [documentation](https://zineland.github.io/) are great resources for getting started with zine.

### Tracking issue

For each magazine issue, it is recommended to create a dedicated GitHub tracking issue, such as [#4]. This gives us a birds-eye view of the progress made in the current issue, and it can be closed after the latest issue has been published.

### Topic

Each article can have zero, one, or several topics. Each topic should be declared in the root `zine.toml` in advance. As editors, we should provide a description of the topic and help the authors categorize their articles.

### Article

- **path**

We prefer to maintain control over article paths and do not generally allow authors to set their own `path` in the article metadata. This helps to keep the article paths organized under the issue slug.

```toml
[[article]]
path = "/cool-article"
file = "cool-article.md"
...
```

For example, the article above will render to `https://rustmagazine.org/cool-article` instead of `https://rustmagazine.org/issue-1/cool-article`. We should request the author to remove the `path` property.

In some significant circumstances, such as the announcing article: `https://rustmagazine.org/announcing/`, customizing the path may be permitted.

```toml
[[article]]
path = "/announcing"
file = "announcing.md"
title = "Announcing Rust Magazine"
author = "rust-magazine"
topic = ["announcement"]
...
```

- **canonical**

When articles are reposted from their original source, it is important to include a `canonical` property to help prevent duplicate content issues for search engines.

```toml
[[article]]
file = "hidden-control-flow.md"
title = "The Hidden Control Flow â€” Some Insights on an Async Cancellation Problem in Rust"
canonical = "https://greptime.com/blogs/2023-01-12-hidden-control-flow.html"
...
```

> ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_link_element) on Wikipedia.

### Issue publishing

Before publishing an issue, all articles should have `publish = false` set in their metadata. A dedicated PR can be submitted to publish all articles at once, as seen in [#31]. After the issue has been published, a git tag (such as the [`issue-1` tag]) should be created for the last commit of the issue.

> Pro Tip: It's not uncommon to receive typo-fixing PRs a few days after an issue has been published, so waiting a day or two before creating a tag may be a good strategy to catch any last minute updates.
