Dear Rustaceans,

We are excited to announce the release of Issue 3 of Rust Magazine! This issue features a diverse range of articles that explore various aspects of Rust programming, from performance optimization to memory statistics and everything in between.

In this edition, we have the pleasure of speaking with robjtede, the core maintainer of Actix Web and [deps.rs](https://deps.rs), who shares his insights on the development of Actix Web and the challenges of managing a large open-source project.

We also have articles on how Rust Search Extension indexes the top 20k crates to provide a instant search experience, and the pursuit of performance in building a JavaScript compiler.

Additionally, we delve into the comprehensive understanding of unsafe Rust and compare it to Zig's safety features in a thought-provoking article.

**Another important news is that we opened an [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/rustmagazine) account for Rust Magazine to receive donations from the community so that we can pay our contributors for incentivizing them to write more high-quality articles. We are also looking for sponsors to help us pay for the domain and email newsletter costs. If you are interested in helping us, please contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/DdwgBuReJe) or email us at [opencollective@rustmagazine.com](mailto://opencollective@rustmagazine.com).**

We hope that this issue of Rust Magazine provides valuable insights and inspiration to Rustaceans of all levels. Thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to bringing you more exciting content in future issues!

Best regards,

The Rust Magazine Team.
