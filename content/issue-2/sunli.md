# Introduction

**Introduce yourself and share a bit about your background with Rust. When did you start learning Rust, and what inspired you to do so?**

```quote
author="Sun Li"
content="I started learning and using Rust three years ago, and used it in work. My main programming language was C ++ before, but I have been looking for a language that can replace it. When I discovered the Rust language, I have been using it to complete all my work, so far I am very satisfied."
```

# Async-graphql

**Can you explain what async-graphql is and how it differs from other GraphQL libraries?**

```quote
author="Sun Li"
content="GraphQL is a query language for APIs. Async-graphql is a server-side library used to implement the GraphQL specification. It utilizes procedural macros to enhance the development experience and fully supports asynchronous."
```

**What inspired you to create async-graphql, and what has the response been like from the Rust community?**

```quote
author="Sun Li"
content="After studying the Rust language for half a year, I wanted to develop something to give back to the community and also improve my Rust skills by developing this project. After the first version was released, I received a lot of encouragement from people who hoped that I would continue to improve it, as it was the only GraphQL library supporting asynchronous at that time."
```

# Poem

**Can you tell us about Poem and its design philosophy?**

```quote
author="Sun Li"
content="I wanted a web framework that may not have the best performance, but would be relatively simple to use, which is why I made it."
```

**What inspired you to develop another web framework, and how does Poem differ from other Rust web frameworks?**

```quote
author="Sun Li"
content="""
Rust has many excellent web frameworks, and Poem may not necessarily be better than them, but it belongs to me, and I can freely modify it, which is the most important thing.
"""
```

**Can you share any exciting upcoming features or plans for Poem?**

```quote
author="Sun Li"
content="There is no plan currently as the functionalities provided by Poem are already sufficient for my needs."
```

# Open-source

**What are the most challenging aspects of maintaining two popular open-source projects like async-graphql and Poem?**

```quote
author="Sun Li"
content="I didn't expect these two libraries to have so many users, so I need a lot of time to solve the problems they encounter. I often work more than 12 hours for this, but I am happy to be able to help them in the end."
```

**How do you balance maintaining these projects with other commitments?**

```quote
author="Sun Li"
content="This is difficult to balance, in fact I was relatively idle when developing these two projects."
```

# End question

**Are there any other hobbies or interests that you have, and how do you balance them with your work on Rust projects?**

```quote
author="Sun Li"
content="I only have two hobbies, writing programs and playing games. When I feel tired, I play games to relax. This is the secret to my ability to maintain work efficiency for a long time."
```
