# RustShip #1 â€” Creating successful open-source projects

RustShip is a new podcast where I interview other Rust developers to learn from their experiences.

In the first episode, I interviewed [Orhun](https://orhun.dev/), Arch Linux package maintainer and author of tens of open-source projects used and loved by thousands of people, including myself.

Orhun shared what it's like maintaining Rust code and his advice on increasing the adoption of our open-source projects.
