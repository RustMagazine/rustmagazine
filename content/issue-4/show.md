We are excited to announce a new topic in Rust Magazine called `#show-magazine`. This is a dedicated space for Rustaceans to showcase their projects and crates to the larger Rust community. Similar to [Show HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew) or [Show /r/rust](https://www.google.com.hk/search?q=site%3Areddit.com+show+%2Fr%2Frust), **#show-magazine** is an opportunity for developers to share their works-in-progress, completed projects, and upcoming Rust-related events with the community. It is the perfect platform to receive feedback, connect with other Rust enthusiasts, and celebrate the diverse range of projects being developed in the Rust ecosystem.

We encourage everyone to participate in **#show-magazine** by submitting their projects and crates to Rust Magazine.
